**Holidays** are periods of celebration during which people are given time off from their regular activities to engage in practices that promote unity, such as national holidays and Independence Day. These occasions celebrate the values that bring us together. 

A **Holiday Reminder** is a program that stores and manages holiday information, and notifying users. In this tutorial, weâ€™ll build a simple but yet effective holidays, trips and travel reminder system using Python. We will leverage python powerful date-handling capabilities and useful built-in libraries for this objective.
We will break down the process of building the project into 4 four steps, each with explanations and example python codes.
